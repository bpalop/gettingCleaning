Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course


* run_analysis.R is the only Script
* I assume all needed data is in the working directory under folder "UCI HAR Dataset" with the structure it creates when decompressing (i.e. all downloads are of the form "./UCI HAR Dataset/[file/folder]"
* The script loads all files and creates "./tiny.csv"
